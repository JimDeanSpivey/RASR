This Eclipse plugin works to record actions on an SSH terminal connection. This actions are saved as python statements which rely on pexpect. There are 3 eclipse projects versioned. The feature project is needed to contain the plugin for intallation (Eclipse prefers to install a feature which contains plugins). And the update site project allows for the feature project to be built as an update site.
